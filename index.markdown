I am a graduate student in the [Physics Department](https://www.physics.ucsb.edu/) at [UC, Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu/), working towards my PhD in Physics with an emphasis in Astrophysics. 
My research focuses on the high-redshift (z > 5) intergalactic medium. 
As a part of the [ENIGMA](http://enigma.physics.ucsb.edu/) group, I combine observations and simulations to study the universe. 
I am interested in answering questions about the epoch of reionization and the nature of dark matter.
